# CSC 495 - Privacy

## Course Description

This course introduces data privacy in a broad sense, with the aim of providing students interested in pursuing privacy research an overview of challenging research areas and problems regarding privacy. This course will expose students to many of the issues that privacy engineers, program managers, researchers and designers deal with in industry.

There is no textbook for this course. We will use research papers as the main source of information. In each lecture, we will look at an interesting problem, its application areas, and possible solutions. Moreover, we will have case studies to investigate privacy incidents in more detail. Specifically, we will study the following privacy areas:

- Web/Online Social Networks Privacy: We will look at growing privacy concerns in online social networks, sharing behaviors of users, common violations and regret scenarios, methods for targeted advertising and how to mitigate those, and k-anonymity for privacy of datasets.

- AI for Privacy: We will look at privacy aware autonomous systems, investigate the design and maintenance of such systems using AI techniques such as negotiation and argumentation. We will investigate frameworks for elicitation, modeling, and verification of privacy requirements. We will look at privacy norms and investigate privacy breaches as norm violations.

- Usable Privacy: We will look at various designs for usable privacy interfaces, privacy nudges for warning users of potential privacy risks, and semantic analysis of privacy policies.

- Privacy Perceptions: We will look at studies and surveys regarding human mental models about privacy concerns, differences among cultures, and longitudinal studies about changes in privacy perceptions.

- Misc Topics: We will look at additional topics such as crowdsourcing privacy policies, mobile application privacy, and privacy measurement.

Learning Outcomes: Students who complete this course will be able to

- Understand personal identifiable information in databases and techniques to anonymize and protect such information

- Describe attacks against anonymized datasets

- Understand privacy risks when sharing personal data online and design mechanisms for mitigating such risks

- Describe privacy requirements and AI techniques for designing privacy-aware autonomous systems

- Design usable privacy interfaces and tools that balance privacy preserving and user functionality

- Identify and describe important elements of privacy policies and regulations

- Understand human attitudes to and perceptions of privacy

Title: No (Privacy) News is Good News: An Analysis of New York Times and Guardian Privacy News from 2010–2016

Abstract: Privacy news influences end-user attitudes and behaviors as well as product and policy development, and so is an important data source for understanding privacy perceptions. We provide a largescale text mining of privacy news, focusing on patterns in sentiment and keywords. This is a challenging task given the lack of a privacy news repository and a ground truth for sentiment. Using high-precision data sets from two popular news sources in the US and UK, the New York Times and the Guardian, we find negative privacy news is far more common than positive. In addition, in the NYT, privacy news is more prominently reported than many world events involving significant human suffering. Our analysis provides a rich snapshot of this driver of privacy perceptions and demonstrates that news facilitates the systematization of privacy knowledge.
